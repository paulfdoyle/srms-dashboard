    <h5 class="mb-2">How to use this page</h5>
    <ul class="mb-0">
      <li>Each section shows a specific comparison between the <strong>Akari</strong> and <strong>R27</strong> datasets.</li>
      <li>Use the <em>“View”</em> dropdown (top-right) to display all sections or just a single category.</li>
      <li><strong>Title comparison</strong> is asymmetric: award text is removed on Akari only (e.g. “Bachelor of Engineering Technology in …”), then both sides normalize synonyms (“Eng” ≡ “Engineering”, “Uni” ≡ “University”; “&amp;” ≡ “and”).</li>
      <li><strong>School comparison</strong> ignores “&amp;” vs “and”.</li>
